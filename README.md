# Welcome to the test task repo!

### Description
My name is Alexander Petrenko and I have been working on this task for couple days.
The task was to make a WebAPI and a website (application), that would use the API.

### The Task
The application should be something like Trello board: it needs to store information about projects and tasks and the app required to have tools to control the stored information.

!! Edit and Delete functions are not working in the application yet, but everything do work in WebAPI !!

Please check a short video that demonstrates a work of the app: https://youtu.be/gzVk8Y-_F1I
