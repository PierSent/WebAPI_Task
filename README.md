# Welcome to the test task repo!

My name is Alexander Petrenko and I have been working on this task for couple days.
The task was to make a WebAPI and a website (application), that would use the API.
The application should be something like Trello board: it needs to store information about projects and tasks and the app required to have tools to control the stored information.
